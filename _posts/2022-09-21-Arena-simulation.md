## INTRODUCTION:
**Arena** is a discreate-event simulation and automation software developed by System Modeling and aquired by Rockwell Automation in 2000.

As time flies and currently, it emcompasses the Information Age - an era marked by rapid adoption of new technologies, Arena is not as popular as 10 years ago. However, Arena itselfs still very easy-to-use, powerful modeling and simulation software tool that allows user to construct a simulation model and run experiments on the model. Arena also generates several reports as a result of a simulation run.

I have been applied Arena in different models included Technical Support in Call Center Simulation, Batch Services, Glasses Assemblely.

Arena gave me  a general idea of how a queing system look like, helped me to understand the logic of a simulation question that normally hard to imagine sometime.
