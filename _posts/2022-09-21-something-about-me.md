### My study journey:
***“The important thing is not to stop questioning. Curiosity has its own reason for existence. One cannot help but be in awe when he contemplates the mysteries of eternity, of life, of the marvelous structure of reality. It is enough if one tries merely to comprehend a little of this mystery each day. Never lose a holy curiosity” – Albert Einstein***

This quote portrayed my inspiration when I decided to pursue a bachelor’s degree in Industrial Management. After reflecting on my relentless curiosity and enthusiasm, I realized that it is the mechanism of things that fires up my learning passion. I always think that there is more beneath the human-facing surface of a machine, even household appliances, so I always try to acquire a conceptual understanding of how they work. When the registration data came, I opted for Industrial Management and have never regretted it. After finishing my bachelor’s degree, I realized how my curiosity remained flaring, that I am still quenching a thirst for knowledge. I sought challenges to go beyond the boundaries of Industrial Management.

I yearn to acquire more technical skills. My bachelor’s degree prepared me with a deep understanding of industrial processes from a theoretical perspective. However, I was concerned that the program’s curriculum was lackluster when it came to hands-on technical training. With my heart set on applying my knowledge to optimize and improve industrial processes in a wide range of settings, from manufacturing to services, I decided to proactively prepare myself with more practical and employable skill set. I signed up for a 3-month training course for the certificate of Business Process Integration with SAP S/4HANA (the number one ERP solution for big enterprises). With both theory and hands-on practice to integrate SAP S/4HANA system into a company to improve its performance, the course has reaffirmed my concern and my dream to pursue an advanced degree highly focused on practical skill sets. Based on later research, I learned that a Master of Industrial Engineering would offer what I’m seeking.

### My Career:
I graduated in April 2021 from a four-year Bachelor's Degree in Industrial Management at Centria University of Applied Sciences.
Right before graduated, I took two internships continuously and start to have some very first experience about the industry. From that experience, I gradually realized my career goal, to become a supply chain analyst. I have observed tremendous progress made by developed countries in training for a new generation of employees. However, businesses in my country - Vietnam have never really had in-depth and systematic research to optimize the workforce. That left a big gap that I want to bridge. To achieve the goal, I find it essential to learn technical knowledge so that I can come up with strategic planning to optimize productivity. I also advocate for the adoption of new information technologies, because they will play a big role in the plan. 

Early 2020, at ***Mainam JSC*** – the top 3 biggest plastic packaging companies in the Northside of Vietnam, I served as ***Logistic and Trade Coordinator***. My team and I conducted research for a better supplier of virgin HDPE to meet the raw material shortage caused by covid-19. Fortunately, we have found a new supplier from Taiwan who has offered a reasonable price quotation and at the same time, they have become a customer who is looking for a Vietnamese manufacturer to produce sanitize products. We have taken the right opportunity to make a win-win situation. As a result, I developed my organizational skill and acquired a multi-tasking ability. During the year 2019, I worked as a ***Production and Logistics Assistant*** where I gained a tremendous amount of insight into the real food supply chain. I have acquired real-world experience in inventory management, packing solutions, and order tracking processes at the company. The opportunity to learn Excel and Tableau reporting tools has been very beneficial to me. Ultimately, my experience living and working in Vietnam and European countries gives me a unique perspective on the supply chain in that region.
