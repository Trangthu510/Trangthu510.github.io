• In addition to doing my job effectively, another of my ambitions is to enhance the working environment in any organization that employs me. Through my positions in different organizations from Vietnam to Finland, I have recognized that while I thrive when working independently, I am also fulfilled when I am a member of a successful team.

• My undergraduate experience in Finland demonstrates my willingness to take risks. At age 20, I relocated by myself almost 5,000 miles to a new country where I subsequently earned a degree by taking classes exclusively in my second language.

• My experience with supply chain companies has enabled me to cultivate high-level technical skills as well as interpersonal skills that I continue to hone.

• I am primarily interested in supply chain and data analyst roles in healthcare companies; however, I would not limit myself to that industry. 

• I am grateful in advance for any recommendations and support I will receive as I explore new career opportunities.
