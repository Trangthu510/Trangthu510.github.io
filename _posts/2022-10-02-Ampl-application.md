A thousand questions are asked everyday by everyone and to be able to answer all of them, we need to PAYING ATTENTION!!, DOING LOT OF RESEARCH, and of course even PAYING MONEY just to get an answer.

This is the reason why I was strong interested in finding the answer and solving this problem. This small project is created based on setting up **a complex mathematical question**, using **AMPL** application to solve.
The data set contained very basic information about nutritions of **PARTS OF MY FAVORITE FOOD COLLECTION**.
